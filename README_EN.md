## 🛡️ Security Scanning Details

### Scanning Mechanism

Our security scanning engine analyzes every file of skill code to detect potential risks:

- **Parallel scanning acceleration**: Parallel scanning technology greatly improves scan speed for local installed skills/plugins
- **Symbolic link detection**: Immediately hard-block on symlink discovery, prevent attacks
- **Multi-format support**: Support `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.rs` and other code formats
- **Platform adaptation**: Added UTF-16 decoding and text confidence validation, extended Windows/multi-language support

### Scoring System Principles

#### How is the Security Score Calculated?

The security score uses a **100-point deduction mechanism**, starting from 100 points and deducting points based on detected risks:

1. **Initial Score**: 100 points (full score)
2. **Risk Deduction**: For each risk detected, deduct points based on its weight
3. **Same-Rule Deduplication**: Deduct points only once per rule in the same file (avoiding duplicate deductions)
4. **Score Accumulation**: All risk deductions accumulate, minimum to 0 points

#### Scoring Example

Assume the following risks are detected:

| Risk Item                     | Weight | Description                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `rm -rf /` (hard trigger)     | 100    | Installation prohibited directly   |
| `curl \| bash`                | 90     | Deduct 90 points                  |
| `eval()`                      | 6      | Deduct 6 points                   |
| `os.system()`                 | 6      | Deduct 6 points                   |
| Hardcoded API Key             | 60     | Deduct 60 points                  |
| **Total Score**               | -      | 100 - 90 - 6 - 6 - 60 = **-62**  |

Due to the presence of hard-trigger rules, installation is directly blocked.

#### Scoring Levels

- **90-100 (✅ Safe)**: Safe to use
  - No or only very low-risk items
  - No hard-trigger rules detected

- **70-89 (⚠️ Low Risk)**: Minor risk, recommend checking details
  - Few low-risk items
  - Decide whether to use based on needs

- **50-69 (⚠️ Medium Risk)**: Certain risk, use with caution
  - Medium-risk items present
  - Recommend carefully reviewing code before use

- **30-49 (🔴 High Risk)**: High risk, not recommended for installation
  - Multiple high-risk items
  - Strongly recommend finding alternatives

- **0-29 (🚨 Critical Risk)**: Serious threat, installation prohibited
  - Hard-trigger rules triggered
  - System directly blocks installation

### Hard-Trigger Protection Mechanism

**What are Hard-Trigger Rules?**

Hard-trigger rules are "red lines" set by the system. Once triggered, installation is immediately blocked without giving users a chance to take risks. These rules correspond to **extremely dangerous** operations, including:

- 🚨 **Destructive Operations** (8 rules): `rm -rf /`, disk wiping, formatting, etc.
- 🚨 **Remote Code Execution** (10 rules): `curl | bash`, reverse shell, PowerShell encoded commands, etc.
- 🚨 **Privilege Escalation** (1 rule): sudoers file modification
- 🚨 **Persistence Backdoor** (1 rule): SSH key injection
- 🚨 **Sensitive File Access** (2 rules): Reading shadow file, Windows credential store

Totaling **22 hard-trigger rules**, covering the most common attack vectors.

### Confidence Grading

To reduce false positives, each risk is marked with a confidence level:

- **🎯 High**: Low possibility of false positives, should focus on
- **🎯 Medium**: Some possibility of false positives, recommend manual review
- **🎯 Low**: High possibility of false positives, for reference only

**Score Adjustment**: Low-confidence risks have lower weights in scoring to avoid false positives causing excessively low scores.

### Risk Classification

| Category                  | Detection Content           | Examples                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Destructive Operations** | Delete system files, disk wipe | `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`           |
| **Remote Code Execution**  | Pipe execution, deserialization | `curl \| bash`, `pickle.loads` |
| **Command Injection**      | Dynamic command concatenation | `eval()`, `os.system()`       |
| **Data Exfiltration**      | Data exfiltration to remote servers | `curl -d @file`             |
| **Privilege Escalation**   | Escalation operations       | `sudo`, `chmod 777`           |
| **Persistence**            | Backdoor implantation       | `crontab`, SSH key injection    |
| **Sensitive Info Leakage** | Hardcoded keys, Tokens      | AWS Key, GitHub Token           |
| **Sensitive File Access**  | Access system sensitive files | `~/.ssh/`, `/etc/passwd`    |

### Disclaimer

Security scanning is based on preset rules, designed to help identify potential risks, but cannot guarantee 100% accuracy, and false positives or false negatives may exist. It is recommended to carefully read the skill source code before installation and be extra cautious with skills from untrusted sources. Users assume all consequences of using this program.
